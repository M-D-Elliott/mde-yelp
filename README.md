Hey!

Welcome to my ***Yelp review forwarding and processing*** API.

***http://localhost:8080/api/reviews/zv_XJAQr9D3PNR5eHYhC5w***

Here's the endpoint I've been hitting for testing:
it's simply the business ID; I've been using
something lagrossa's? bar in Minneapolis!

***ID: zv_XJAQr9D3PNR5eHYhC5w***

You'll have to supply ***your own API keys*** first.

Check out the ***resources.appInfo***

***Ignore jPlus*** it's only there because
I am lazy and like to reuse my validations.
